## Ticketing System Integration

The application is designed to forward purchase order requests to a ticketing system. Currently, it:

2. **Generates a ticket number** (format: PO-YYYYMMDD-XXXX)
3. **Displays success confirmation** with all submitted details

### To integrate with your ticketing system:

2. **Add your ticketing API endpoint**
3. **Configure authentication** if required
4. **Handle API responses** and error states

Example integration:

```javascript
const handleFormSubmit = async (formData) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/tickets', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      setSubmittedData(formData);
      setShowSuccessModal(true);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to submit ticket:', error);
    // Handle error state
  }
};
```
